<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

<p>De Casteljau's algorithm works by calculating linear interpolations n-1 times using a parameter t, where n is the number of control points given. Using a recursive process, it calculates new points along the lines between
  consecutive control points, and connects the new points in a similar sequential manner until the last point is calculated. This last point lies on the resulting curve, with the last calculated line being a tangent line
  to the curve. I implemented this section by simply iterating through all the given control points, calculating all the linearly interpolated points using these control points and appending them to a vector that is returned at
  the end of the iterative process.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<p>
De Casteljau's algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by simply running the same algorithm again but across multiple Bezier curves to create a surface.
In this case, we are given n x n control points, with u and v being the parameters that shifts where the linearly interpolated points will be (previously
t for the 1D case). We first calculate the first n bezier curves using the u parameter, and then finally we can interpolate the surface using parameter u
and the final interpolated points from the bezier curves, which is the exact same algorithm as the 1D case.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>
<p>
I implemnented area-weighted vertex normals by calculating the normal vector of each triangle incident to our given vertex by getting the corss product of two 
edge vectors of the triangle, then keeping track of a running sum of the normal vectors (We don't need to weight it by area because the cross product vector magnitude
is proportional to the area of the triangle already). Finally, we return the normalized sum.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<p>
The edge flip operation is pretty straighforward in terms of coding; the important/hard part was keeping track of all the pointers to our halfedges. I first drew a
diagram of two triangles with a potential edge flip, naming all the vertices and edges, and then creating pointers to each edge and naming them based on the vertices
that they're connected to so that it's easier for my to keep track of which halfedge elements I need to change for each halfedge. This part was not very difficult for me,
and the only issue I encountered was I didn't consider the need to set the face to point at the given halfedge and halfedge twin. This resulted in holes in some surfaces
when I tested out my edge flips, but I was able to quickly resolve this once I figured out the issue.

      </td>

    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<p>Similar to the edge flip operation, the hard part of the edge split operation was to keep track of the pointers. Thus, I similarly laid out all the edges first 
  based on a diagram I drew, and I also had to create new edges and faces and a single vertex. Everything onwards is pretty straighforward, as it simply required me to
  set the correct neighbors for each edge, and to also calculate the position of my new vertex and setting the halfedge of the vertex to one of the edges connected to this
  new vertex. Once again, I encountered holes after splitting some edges like in part 4, and I realized I once again forgot to correctly set the faces so that it points to our
  given halfedge and twin. Since I had already solves this in the previous section however, this was not a major problem and did not take a long time to resolve.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<p>
  In this section, I followed the recommended steps given in the spec to implement the subdivision algorithm, so I first calculated all the new vertex positions, then I split
  on all the pre-exisitng edges and flipped edges that are connected to an old vertex and a new vertex. This method smoothes out our meshes as it creates new triangles through
  the process of upsampling. Some issues I ran into while coding this section included realizing that I needed to set the isNew property for edges in my splitEdge function and 
  to set my vertices correctly in flipEdges. I also ran into issues with float arithmetic and infinite looping while going through all the old, pre-exisiting edges for edge splits,
  as it turned out that I was checking for old edges using the wrong condition.

<p>After subdivision, we can clearly see that sharp corners and edges are become much smoother due to upsampling. If we pre-split some edges before subdivision, we see that this 
  smoothness becomes more enhanced at the same iterations of subdivision. 
</p>
<p>We can pre-process the cube with edge splits to make the resulting shape is symmetrical. To do this, I split on the edge that lies on each face of the cube, so that each
  face has two edges that cross each other instead of just one. The reason why our original cube does not subdivide symmetrically is because the edge on each face of the cube
  makes it asymmetrical.
